# autozim (bkm) ðŸ¤–

The purpose of this tool/script is to automate the process of using zimit/browsertrix/webcrawler to download content. Created for educational/archival/EC purposes only.

- automatically convert bookmarks in folder/bkm.txt
- downloads websites listed in ./bkm.txt (using docker desktop) - (image: browsertrix-webcrawler)
- prepares the downloaded WARCs to be converted into zimfiles
- execute these commands to convert multiple compressed folders/WARCs to usable format_file.zim (Kiwix, etc...)
- output a simple_file.zim and then cleans the directory if the conversion if successful
- cleans docker env before proceeding to download the next website
- reiterate until all ./bkm.txt is peeled
- enjoy
